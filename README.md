# Berlin-Kriminalitaetsatlas
Looking crime rates in Berlin districts 
Inspiation for this came from my favourite true crime podcast - Zeit Verbrechen and https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html &
https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/crime-watch.html

I downloaded the data https://www.berlin.de/polizei/service/kriminalitaetsatlas/

I will continue to clean up the code and maybe add some features
